# Physical-Objects-Asset-Library
Blender asset library of physical objects, that can be used as a reference for modeling items, that will be printed or manufactured any other way.  
With my models I use metric unit systhem with unit scale of 0.1 and and mark lenght in milimeters. With that, export to stl has to be scaled 100 times.
